# English translation of SGA4½

This repository contains an [English translation](https://github.com/Shaw2048/translation/blob/main/SGA4%C2%BD.pdf) of Deligne's [SGA4½](https://publications.ias.edu/node/378).

Based on Daniel Miller's [LaTeX rendition](https://github.com/NomiL/sga4.5/) of SGA4½ , this was possible via a Python program connecting to the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/product). It directly translated LaTeX source codes and kept almost all LaTeX commands unchanged.

This preliminary version surely contains many typos, and it will be updated frequently in the future. The last chapter on derived category is not contained.

Thanks to the power of artificial intelligence nowadays,
